SmartSDLC: AI-Powered Requirement Extraction using Natural Language Processing
SmartSDLC is an innovative project designed to demonstrate how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can intelligently enhance the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), with a strong focus on the requirement gathering phase. Traditionally, identifying software requirements from client communication has been a manual, time-consuming process prone to human oversight. SmartSDLC leverages cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate this task, using a transformer-based AI model—specifically, Hugging Face's facebook/bart-large-mnli for zero-shot classification. This enables the system to understand and interpret natural language inputs, such as client emails or project outlines, and extract key functional requirements with confidence scores, without any prior training on the specific input. The project is built in Python and optimized to run in Google Colab, making it both accessible and easy to experiment with. For example, given a description like “We are building an e-commerce website. Users should register, login, browse products, and make payments,” the tool automatically extracts clear, actionable requirements such as User Registration, Product Browsing, and Online Payments. This not only accelerates the early phases of SDLC but also increases accuracy and ensures critical features are not missed. Future plans for SmartSDLC include expanding its AI capabilities to generate boilerplate code from extracted requirements, predict potential bugs, and even auto-generate test cases, thus supporting a smarter, AI-driven software development workflow from end to end. Licensed under MIT, this project is part of the broader SmartSDLC series, which aims to integrate intelligent automation into every critical phase of modern software engineering.
